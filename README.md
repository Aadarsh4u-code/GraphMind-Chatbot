# 🤖 GraphMind – “Connecting Knowledge Through Intelligence”

 # 📖 **Overview**  
GraphMind is a **general-purpose AI assistant** built to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of **LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith, RAG, and Agentic AI**.

Unlike simple Q&A bots, GraphMind is designed as a **learning and experimentation platform** that integrates multiple advanced features:  
- **Persistence** (save and resume conversations across sessions)  
- **Streaming responses** (like ChatGPT)  
- **Conversation history & threading** (stored in SQLite)  
- **Tool usage** (external APIs, utilities)  
- **Observability & metrics** with LangSmith (trace, latency, and error tracking)  

This project serves as both a **hands-on playground for developers** and a **scalable blueprint** for building production-ready, multi-modal conversational AI systems.


# 🚀 **Problem Statement**  
Building a truly interactive and observable chatbot requires more than just an LLM. Challenges include:  
- Maintaining **context across conversations**  
- Managing **tools, agents, and workflows**  
- Handling **observability, debugging, and latency tracking**  
- Persisting conversation history for future sessions  
- Designing workflows for **retrieval, reasoning, and response generation**  

**GraphMind** addresses these by combining **LangGraph’s stateful workflows**, **LangChain’s modular components**, and **LangSmith’s observability** into one cohesive assistant.


# 🎯 **Purpose**  
The main purpose of GraphMind is to:  
- Provide a **general-purpose chatbot** for diverse queries.  
- Serve as a **learning project** for experimenting with LangChain, LangGraph, RAG, and agent-based AI.  
- Enable **persistent, multi-session conversations** with chat history.  
- Offer **traceability and observability** for developers to debug and optimize pipelines.


# ⚙️ **Features**  
- 💬 **Interactive Conversations** – Chat like ChatGPT with memory.  
- 🛠️ **Tool Integration** – Extend chatbot with external APIs/utilities.  
- 🔄 **Persistence** – Store chats, threads, and history in SQLite.  
- ⚡ **Streaming Responses** – Token-by-token outputs for a natural experience.  
- 📊 **Observability & Metrics** – Integrated with LangSmith for tracing, latency, and evaluation.  
- 🧠 **RAG-Powered** – Retrieve and ground answers from stored knowledge.  
- 🔗 **Graph Workflows** – Orchestrate reasoning via LangGraph.


# 🛠️ **Tech Stack**  
- **Backend & Orchestration**: LangChain, LangGraph  
- **LLMs**: OpenAI / HuggingFace (pluggable) | meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct | mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2
- **RAG**: FAISS / ChromaDB (vector stores)  
- **Observability**: LangSmith  
- **Persistence**: SQLite (conversation history & threads)  
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (simple UI)  
- **Deployment**: Docker / Streamlit Cloud


# 📊 **Workflow**  
1. **User Input** – User asks a question or starts a conversation.  
2. **Context Management** – Retrieve previous conversation history (SQLite).  
3. **RAG Retrieval** – Relevant documents fetched from vector DB.  
4. **LangGraph Orchestration** – Routes request through LLMs, tools, and chains.  
5. **Response Generation** – LLM crafts an answer.  
6. **Streaming + Storage** – Response streamed to UI and logged into SQLite.  
7. **Observability** – Trace captured in LangSmith for monitoring/debugging.


# 🖥️ **Example Usage**  

**Input:**  
```  
"What are the key differences between LangChain and LangGraph?"  
```  
**Output:**  
```  
LangChain is a framework for composing modular AI pipelines (chains, tools, and agents).  
LangGraph extends LangChain by introducing graph-based state machines, making it easier to define multi-step, branching conversational workflows with persistence.
